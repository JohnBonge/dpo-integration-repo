# IremboPay Product Mapping Fix

## üêõ **Issues Identified**

The IremboPay product mapping had several mismatches between the database titles and the mapping configuration.

### **Main Issue Fixed**

**Tour Package:** `cm4fogxvw0000mm0fkuq5woap` (Kigali City Tour)

**Problem:** Title mismatch between database and mapping

- **Database Title:** `"Kigali city Tour"` (lowercase 'c')
- **Mapping Title:** `"Kigali City Tour"` (uppercase 'C')

**Result:** This caused confusion and potential issues in payment processing since the mapping title didn't match the actual tour package title.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Fixes Applied**

### 1. Title Correction

**File:** `lib/services/irembopay-product-mapping.ts`

**Change:**

```typescript
// Before
{
  tourPackageId: 'cm4fogxvw0000mm0fkuq5woap', // Kigali City Tour
  iremboProductCode: 'PC-74ac3ffe8a',
  tourName: 'Kigali City Tour', // ‚ùå Incorrect title
  price: 200.0,
  currency: 'USD',
}

// After
{
  tourPackageId: 'cm4fogxvw0000mm0fkuq5woap', // Kigali city Tour
  iremboProductCode: 'PC-74ac3ffe8a',
  tourName: 'Kigali city Tour', // ‚úÖ Fixed to match database
  price: 200.0,
  currency: 'USD',
}
```

### 2. Comment Corrections

**Fixed typos in product code comments:**

1. **Nyungwe Product Code:**

   - Before: `PC-a79ei91fb4` (incorrect)
   - After: `PC-a79e19f1b4` (correct)

2. **Whole Rwanda Adventure Product Code:**
   - Before: `PC-2d9d48O7f` (incorrect - contains letter 'O')
   - After: `PC-2d19d4807f` (correct - contains digit '0')

## üéØ **Impact**

### **Before Fix:**

- Payment initialization might fail due to title mismatch
- Confusion between displayed title and mapping
- Potential IremboPay API errors

### **After Fix:**

- ‚úÖ Exact title match between database and mapping
- ‚úÖ Consistent product identification
- ‚úÖ Smoother payment processing
- ‚úÖ Accurate documentation in comments

## üîç **Validation**

The specific booking that was failing (`cmca67wwb0001ky09o0ti435i`) was for the "Kigali city Tour" package. With this fix:

1. **getIremboProductCode()** function will return the correct product code
2. **Payment initialization** will use the accurate tour title
3. **IremboPay API calls** will be consistent with the mapping

## üìù **Additional Notes**

- The mapping now correctly reflects the actual database title: `"Kigali city Tour"`
- All product codes in comments have been verified for accuracy
- The validation script `validate-irembopay-mappings.ts` has been created to prevent future mismatches

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy** the updated mapping
2. **Test** payment flow for the Kigali city Tour package
3. **Run validation script** periodically to catch future mismatches
4. **Monitor** payment success rates for all mapped packages
